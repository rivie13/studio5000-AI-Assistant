# ‚úÖ Team Member Onboarding Checklist

## üöÄ **New Team Member Setup**

### **Day 1: Basic Setup**
- [ ] **Read** [TEAM_USAGE_GUIDE.md](TEAM_USAGE_GUIDE.md) for complete workflow understanding
- [ ] **Install** Python 3.12 from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads/) 
- [ ] **Clone** the Studio5000_MCP_Server repository
- [ ] **Install** dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] **Install** Studio 5000 SDK wheel file (critical for .ACD creation)
- [ ] **Test** installation: `python src/mcp_server/studio5000_mcp_server.py --test`
- [ ] **Configure** Claude Desktop with MCP server (see README.md)

### **Day 2: Practice Project**
- [ ] **Create** practice project folder following team structure
- [ ] **Export** one simple routine from existing Studio 5000 project  
- [ ] **Ask AI** to make minor improvement (add comment, simple modification)
- [ ] **Import** result back into Studio 5000 and verify it compiles
- [ ] **Keep** [QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md](QUICK_REFERENCE_CARD.md) handy for commands

### **Day 3: Real Project Work**
- [ ] **Shadow** experienced team member on actual project
- [ ] **Practice** with fix scripts on non-critical routines
- [ ] **Try** vector database features (AI using your real hardware names)
- [ ] **Review** [TEAM_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](TEAM_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md) for common issues
